**Ingredients**
- For the Dough:
  - 1 cube of yeast
  - 300 ml warm milk
  - 1 tablespoon sugar
  - 2 teaspoons salt
  - 500 g wheat flour
  - 75 ml oil
  - 2 tablespoons sour cream or another dairy product

- For Brushing:

- For the Topping:
  - 5 tablespoons flour

**Instructions**
1. Dissolve yeast in warm milk, add sugar and 2 tablespoons of flour, mix and let it rest for about 10 minutes.
2. In a mixing bowl, knead the remaining flour with salt, oil, sour cream, and the activated yeast into a smooth dough. Brush the dough with a bit of oil and let it rest, covered, for about 45 minutes until it rises.
3. Divide the dough into 20 pieces, roll out each ball thinly, and roll them up lengthwise. Place on a baking sheet and brush with the oil-milk mixture. Let rest for another 10 minutes.
4. Bake in a preheated oven at 200 Â°C (top and bottom heat) for 10 minutes. Baking time may vary depending on how thin the Kipferl are rolled.
5. For the topping, mix flour with salt and gradually add water. The consistency should be like pancake batter.
6. After 10 minutes of baking, remove the Kipferl from the oven and drizzle with the topping. Then bake for an additional 5 minutes.
7. After baking, cover the Kipferl with a damp cloth and let them cool down slightly.
