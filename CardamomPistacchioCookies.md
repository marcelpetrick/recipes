**Cardamom Cookies with Pistachios**
_Preparation Time:_ 15 minutes  
_Cook Time:_ 10 minutes  
_Waiting Time:_ 2 hours  
_Servings:_ 48 cookies  

**Ingredients**

- 240 g butter, room temperature
- 100 g powdered sugar
- 2 tsp ground cardamom
- 2 pinches of salt
- 300 g flour
- 100 g pistachios, shelled, unsalted, chopped

**Instructions**

1. Cream the butter and powdered sugar for about 1 minute. Add the cardamom powder and salt and stir in. Also briefly stir in the flour until a relatively soft dough is formed.
2. Finally, stir the chopped pistachios into the dough.
3. Form the dough with your hands into a roll with a diameter of about 5 cm, wrap it tightly in cling film and let it set in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
4. Towards the end of the cooling time, preheat the oven to 180Â°C top/bottom heat and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
5. Unwrap the roll and cut it with a sharp knife into 20-24 slices. If necessary, reshape the slices slightly if they become deformed while cutting, and place them on the parchment paper.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes or until the edges just begin to brown. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet.
