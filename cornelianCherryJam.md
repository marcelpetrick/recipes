# Cornelian Cherry Jam (Croatian Style)

This traditional Croatian recipe for Cornelian cherry jam (džem/pekmez od drenjina) balances the fruit’s natural tartness with just enough sweetness.

## Ingredients
- 1 kg ripe Cornelian cherries  
- 300–500 g sugar (adjust to taste)  
- 2 teaspoons citric acid (optional, for brightness)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the fruit**  
   Wash the ripe cherries and remove stems. Place them in a wide pot with a splash of water. Cook over low heat for 20–25 minutes until the fruit softens and begins separating from the pits.  

2. **Remove pits**  
   Press the softened fruit through a sieve or food mill to remove the pits and obtain a smooth pulp.  

3. **Cook with sugar**  
   Return the pulp to the pot, add 300–500 g sugar (depending on desired sweetness), and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring often, until the jam thickens.  

4. **Add citric acid**  
   Toward the end of cooking, stir in the citric acid and let it simmer briefly. This enhances the flavor and helps with preservation.  

5. **Fill the jars**  
   Pour the hot jam into sterilized jars. Seal immediately. Optionally, let a light skin form on top before sealing for longer storage.  

6. **Cool and store**  
   Leave jars to cool, then store in a cool, dark place.
