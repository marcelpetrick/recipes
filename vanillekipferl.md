**Instructions:**
1. **Prepare the Dough**  
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the **flour**, **ground almonds**, **sugar**, and **vanilla sugar**. Add the cold butter pieces and knead everything quickly into a smooth dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for **30 minutes**.

2. **Shape the Vanillekipferl**  
   Preheat the oven to **175°C**.  
   Take small pieces of dough, roll them into thin logs, and form them into crescent shapes (like little moons). Place the crescents on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

3. **Bake**  
   Bake the crescents for **10–15 minutes**, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake.

4. **Coat with Vanilla Sugar**  
   Mix the **powdered sugar** and additional **vanilla sugar** (if desired) in a bowl. While the Vanillekipferl are still warm, gently coat them in the sugar mixture. Allow them to cool completely on a wire rack.
